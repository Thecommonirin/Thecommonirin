# About Me

Hi there! I'm Kejia Chen (陈可嘉), a Ph.D. student at the Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis (VIPA) Lab, supervised by Prof. Zunlei Feng and Prof. Mingli Song.

🔬 My long-term research goal is to build **Trustworthy Machine Learning systems**, with a current focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) in the areas of efficiency, privacy, and security.

🌐 I occasionally share research updates and project progress on my [homepage](https://thecommonirin.github.io/) — feel free to check it out!

📫 If you're interested in collaboration or have any questions, feel free to contact me via [email](irinchan1222@outlook.com).
